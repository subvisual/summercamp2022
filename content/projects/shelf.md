The goal was to build a tool that would enable book sharing within the team in a seamless manner. The outcome was a web app where we list all the books in Subvisual’s library, working as an online repository that allows people to borrow the book online. To help people know which book to choose, the team can add comments and ratings to the ones they’ve read, making this a truly collaborative tool.
